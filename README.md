# MinimalGold

This is my minimal gold theme. Created by me! I want you to get confortable with it, so enjoy it.

## Why?

Beacuse i always look for a theme that can catch my attention and don't be so boring and bad to the eye. So thats why i made up this theme with a little bit of gold and good sintax colors.
